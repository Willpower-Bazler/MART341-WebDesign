     <h3>Just as an FYI, I love this project a ton but I despise the whole LED deal. So I left that part out. The LEDS clash strongly with the architectural burned wood asthetic.</h3>

<h2>Step 1: <i>place the wood</i></h2>
<img src="./images/step1.jpg" alt="step1"> </br>
<p> Arrange the wood the way you would like it to be. After arranging the wood, number all the wood pieces so you know how to arrange them correctly again after moving it. </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>Step 2: <i>glue the wood</i></h2>
<img src="./images/step2.jpg" alt="step2"> </br>
  <p>After you have placed the wooden pieces you can start putting it together with wood glue. When you are done with gluing wait at least 24 hours until the next step. </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Step 3: <i>add the mounting</i></h2>
<img src="./images/step3.jpg" alt="step3"> </br>
<p>To add the mounting for the panels you need to put a wooden panel that is just a bit smaller than the minimum size off the front panel on the back. </br>
To attach the mounting panel, use nails that are just short enough to not go all the way through the front panel.</br>
You can also screw two big metal keyhole brackets on the corners off the mounting panel so it will be easy to hang the panels.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Step 4: <i>burn the panels</i></h2>
<img src="./images/step4.jpg" alt="step4"> </br>
<p>When you are done with making your panels you can start to burn them. Burn until you like the texture and the color.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Step 5: <i>oil the panel</i></h2>
<img src="./images/step5.jpg" alt="step5"> </br>
<p>After you burn the panels, give the panels a coat of the oil with a brush to make the wood a bit darker.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Step 6: <i>mount the panel</i></h2>
<img src="./images/step6.jpg" alt="step6"> </br>
<p>To mount the panels you need to screw some screws in the wall where the holes off the keyhole brackets are. </br>
  When screwing in the screws make sure they stick out a bit so the keyhole brackets have a place to mount to.</p>
