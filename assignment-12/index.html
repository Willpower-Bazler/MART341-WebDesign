  <p>“His strength began as bravery, then quickly calcified into an impenetrable shell.</br>
      An exoskeleton. Her strength was love, always love, nothing but love.</br>
      He was not strong enough to live that way but he wanted to be. He would try.</br>
      He owed it both to her and himself. Anything short of that would be unworthy of</br>
      all the suffering he had endured. The sadness had no point unless he gave it one.”</p>

  <p>“That was the moment Sebastian died. There had been a time when he understood that</br>
    people would go away. Now the person he was had gone away. He was trapped in this present</br>
    with these strangers who already seemed to know who he was, and who he was going to be.”</p>
