<pre>Artemis Fowl is the first book in the Artemis Fowl series. It follows the adventures of Artemis Fowl, a 12 year-old criminal mastermind.
  With the help of his bodyguard, Domovoi Butler, Artemis kidnaps Holly Short, an elf fairy, for a large ransom of gold to restore the Fowl family fortune.
  The Lower Elements Police (LEP) fairy police give multiple attempts to rescue Holly, even sending a criminal dwarf called Mulch Diggums.
  It concludes with Artemis finally releasing Holly, and having the fairies cure his mother of her madness (in exchange for half of the gold that he had stolen from the fairies).</pre>
