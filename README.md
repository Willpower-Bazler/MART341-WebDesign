# MART341-WebDesign-Willpower-Bazler

Assignment 2: This week I made a repository to use for all my assignments for this class. I made a directory for assignment 2, and answered the homework questions. I feel like I had success with everything this week, it just took a little reading on the class website and googling to figure out how to do a couple things.


Week 5: I now realize that instead of using this MART 341 repo, I instead created entirely new repos for each week :( Oh well, at least now I'm on track and instead made a week 5 DIRECTORY inside my MART 341 REPOSITORY. Jeez Will haha. I visited Amazon.com in March 2000, It looks super simplified. I feel like I understand 95% of the material and stuff, I just still have a hard time with linking things.

Week 6: I finally figured out how to make images work! Ugh. At least I hope I did, it showed up in my editor anyway.
A page should have only one head element and one body element. The head is for the info regarding the page itself, like the meta stuff. The body is for everything that you will put in for the public to see on your page.
Structural markup has to do with the information organization, like paragraphs and stuff. Semantic markup emphasizes that  information, like making something bold.
To be honest my work cycle was mostly just to do the assignment as the numbers were ordered.
