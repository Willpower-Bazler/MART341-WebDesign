# MART341-WebDesign-Willpower-Bazler

Assignment 2: This week I made a repository to use for all my assignments for this class. I made a directory for assignment 2, and answered the homework questions. I feel like I had success with everything this week, it just took a little reading on the class website and googling to figure out how to do a couple things.


Week 5: I now realize that instead of using this MART 341 repo, I instead created entirely new repos for each week :( Oh well, at least now I'm on track and instead made a week 5 DIRECTORY inside my MART 341 REPOSITORY. Jeez Will haha. I visited Amazon.com in March 2000, It looks super simplified. I feel like I understand 95% of the material and stuff, I just still have a hard time with linking things.
