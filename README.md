# MART341-WebDesign-Willpower-Bazler

Assignment 2: This week I made a repository to use for all my assignments for this class. I made a directory for assignment 2, and answered the homework questions. I feel like I had success with everything this week, it just took a little reading on the class website and googling to figure out how to do a couple things.

---------------------------------------------------

Week 5: I now realize that instead of using this MART 341 repo, I instead created entirely new repos for each week :( Oh well, at least now I'm on track and instead made a week 5 DIRECTORY inside my MART 341 REPOSITORY. Jeez Will haha.

I visited Amazon.com in March 2000, It looks super simplified.

I feel like I understand 95% of the material and stuff, I just still have a hard time with linking things.

---------------------------------------------------

Week 6: I finally figured out how to make images work! Ugh. At least I hope I did, it showed up in my editor anyway.

A page should have only one head element and one body element. The head is for the info regarding the page itself, like the meta stuff. The body is for everything that you will put in for the public to see on your page.

Structural markup has to do with the information organization, like paragraphs and stuff. Semantic markup emphasizes that  information, like making something bold.

To be honest my work cycle was mostly just to do the assignment as the numbers were ordered. 

---------------------------------------------------

Week 7: This week was satisfying, I love the tables and stuff. Makes it feel like a real webpage.

I guess a form I always use is the youtube search bar. It serves me to search for a song or video and then find it.

An example of a text input would be for something like a username, where you want almost everything on the keyboard available for the input. An example of a selection input could be a "yes" or "no" radio input, where you want to limit the input response or make it specific. An example of a button input would be a "submit" button, where the user can enter all the information for their new account info and then submit it to create an account for a website.

My work cycle was straightforward again, I just did the steps as they were listed.

---------------------------------------------------

Week 8: Trying hard to make a comeback and finish the semester strong.

A div is used to create layouts. A span is used to stylize text, and it's inline so it's only used for small stuff like the inside of a paragraph. An ID can be used to identify an element, where a class can be used to identify multiple elements.

I feel like the biggest advantage to using a service hosted video is that they did all the work for you, and it's just a link rather than a big old file you have to worry about. However, the disadvantage is obviously that you aren't in control of that link, so the video could get taken down without you knowing it and now that's a weak link in your website.

What challenges did I have this week? Well. Haha.

------------------------------------------------------

Week 9: Lotta catching up to do. :( Just trying to crank it out. I'm actually super proud of myself, the unordered lists weren't centering within my div and so after half an hour of googling I figured it out, and used style to bring the dots in to the centered text.

Overall I feel like html is mild to learn ,it's not hard but it's not easy. The most frustrating thing is when you miss one little letter or something like that and the whole thing won't work because of it.

I'm excited to learn about CSS! Style is awesome, I feel like it's where someone's personality comes out.

This whole semester has been a challenge for me. Just trying my best and trying to learn and have fun at the same time. :) The only way through is forward.

------------------------------------------------------

Week 10: Still working hard. CSS was pretty fun to get into, and it's not as hard as I thought it would be which is nice.

Universal selector affects every element in the page. You would use this if you wanted everything in your page to have the exact same style.
Element selector affects all elements of the same type. (Such as every single paragraph <p>.)
Class selectors affect everything that has been given the corresponding class. (Everything with class="blahblah" will be affected by .blahblah.)
ID selectors affect everything that has been given the corresponding ID. (Everything with ID="yayaya" will be affected by #yayaya.)
  
The three colors that I chose were black, red, and orange.
Black: black, 0,0,0, #000000
Red: red, 255,0,0, #FF0000
Orange: orange, 255,128,0, #FF8000

I didn't have any challenges with anything this assignment, it just took a minute to realize that everything that is style is what goes into my style.css. Also, I love colors and all that stuff.

------------------------------------------------------

Week 11: still going crazy. This is one of the coolest looking web pages I've made so far I think.

System fonts are the fonts that are already present and installed on your device.
Web fonts are custom fonts that are hosted on a server.
web safe fonts are reliable fonts that can be counted on to already be on the person's system.

It's important to have fall back fonts in case the first choice doesn't work for some reason. It's like a preventative measure.

I didn't have any challenges for this assignment, it just took a while, since I'm still getting used to using css for everything.

------------------------------------------------------

Week 12: Feels really good to be mostly caught up in this class. Just still going nuts and doing school 24/7. Going a little insane for sure.

The padding is the space in between your text and the border. This allows for better readability. The border surrounds the content, and the margin is the "padding" between the end of the page and the border.

I got rather stuck on the inline block. I couldn't make it center, even though I put text align center on the parent div. Frustrating, but I found an all-right workaround with positioning I guess.
